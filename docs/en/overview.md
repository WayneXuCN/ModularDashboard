# Overview

Modular Dashboard is a local, modular, and extensible information aggregation dashboard. It provides a unified interface to view and manage information from multiple sources, including Papers, GitHub Activity, and RSS Feeds.

## Purpose

Modular Dashboard's main purpose is to provide users with a "first stop for daily information" by aggregating information from multiple sources through a highly customizable card-based layout. This allows users to quickly grasp dynamic information.

### Information Sources

Modular Dashboard currently supports three main information sources:

1. **Papers**: Latest papers
